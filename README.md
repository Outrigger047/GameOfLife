#Conway's Game of Life (C#/Windows Forms)

A silly implementation of Conway's Game of Life that relies on Windows Forms checkboxes overloaded with a simple custom graphic to represent game elements instead of actually doing anything graphically interesting. It runs slowly with bigger files, but I 
was simply interested in implenting the very rudimentary game logic and experimenting with Windows Forms. It was a fun experience that I worked on on and off over several years.
